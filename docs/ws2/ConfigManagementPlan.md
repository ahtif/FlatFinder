# Configuration Management Plan for Group 6

## Source control
This group will use branches for large coding changes, all other changes will be pushed directly into master.

We don't feel that branching for documents or for small coding changes is necessary but do feel that it should be used when new features are added to the source code.

## Code Reviews
This group will perform targeted code reviews at specific times.

Similar to above, we don't feel it is necessary for us to perform a code review on every commit / pull request. However we will perform code reviews when people add new features to the existing code.

## Coding Standards
This group will apply an existing coding standard (e.g. Google's' or Sun's) to this repo.

We have all agreed to use Google's checkstyle as it will ensure the code is of high quality and is easier to understand amongst the group. This also ensures there is consistency in the code of our project.

## Other configuration management practices
none
