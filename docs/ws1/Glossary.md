#Initial Project Glossary - FlatFinder

##Technical Terms

**Agile**- In context of software engineering, agile refers to a specific set of software development methodologies in which software is produced in incremental parts. Agile development puts a strong emphasis on collaboration between designers, developers, testers and end-users in addition to continuous planning, testing and integration.

**Encryption** - is a method of enhancing the security of a password or message by scrambling data to the extent it cannot be read by anyone but the person with the secret code or key.
Sprint

**Requirement** - A desired or necessary documented feature of a system. 

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language complementing the markup language HTML. CSS allows developers to have control over  how content is displayed on browsers.

**HTML** - HyperText Markup Language is the primary language used to create websites on the world wide web. HTML is used by developer to define the structure of a website through the means of tags which tell the browser how to behave. HTML is capable of defining the layout and aesthetics of a website but it is common practise to use CSS instead due to increased efficiency and potency. 

**Scrum** - Scrum is an agile methodology that focuses on iterative and incremental development of software systems. Scrum will be used as an implementation methodology because it allows developers to backtrack and change components of the system without setting it back a lot. 

**Github** - is a web-based version control systems. It allows multiple developers to work on a single project by allowing them to draw from the same source.

**JPEG**- is a lossy image format. JPEG images can be of lower quality than their PNG counterpart, but are generally smaller in size due to quality loss during compression.

**Configuration Management**-  is a thorough and descriptive recording and updating of information that describes a system.

**PNG** - Portable Network Graphics is a lossless image format. Due to lossless data compression the image quality is generally better than JPEG and GIF. This also means that the image file sizes are bigger.

**API** - Application-programming interface is a set of programming routines and protocols. 

**Java** - The main implementation language used to implement the system. Java will be used for cross-platform compatibility. 

**JavaScript** - is a dynamic and untyped programming language used to develop modern websites alongside HTML and CSS. 

**MySQL** - is a relational database management system used to store important information such as login and property details in a database. 

**Gradle** - is an open source build system.

**Cucumber**- is a tool used by developers for testing software. Cucumber runs automated tests written in behavior-driven development style.

**UML** - Unified Modeling Language is a notational language used to visualise and specify complex software.

**HTTP** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an underlying protocol used by the world wide web. This protocol is used to define how messages are transmit and formatted. Additionally, it lets web servers and browsers know what actions 

**Graphical User Interface** - The system's graphical user interface is the visual component of the  that enables user to interact with the system.

##Non-technical Terms

**USER** - Within the context of this project, a user strictly refers to the end-users of the system; these are the landlords, searchers and administrators. 

**LANDLORDS** - A type of user account that enables users to advertise their property. Landlords can upload key information regarding the property they are attempting to let out. This information includes, but is not limited to: Price per month, price per week, number of rooms, dimensions of individual rooms, floor plans, availability dates, addresses and general information about the area. The landlord account types are also able to upload images of their property. Unlike searchers landlords do not have the ability to browse for available property.

**SEARCHERS** - A type of user account that enables users to search the website for available property. Searchers are able to search for property put up for let by landlords. Searchers have the ability to search by the following search criteria: Start and end date, price range and accommodation. Search results display a graphical representation on a map. This map shows the distance between the accommodations to work and university. Additionally, searchers will be able to see public transport and local amenities. Searchers have the ability to express interest in properties and to buddy-up with other searchers. 

**ADMINISTRATORS** - A type of user account used to monitor the content on the software system.  Administrators can receive reports and take various actions they deem appropriate. Administrators can permanently or temporarily suspend users they find are using the system in inappropriate ways. 

**Verification**- Users must register with a valid email address and confirm it before being able to use the system. Verification is used to recover lost passwords. 

**Password Policy** - the password policy is a list of predetermined rules that must be followed in order to successfully choose a password. The password must be at least 8 characters 

**Report** - A feature implemented to notify administrators of malicious, incorrect, inappropriate or any type of misuse of the system.

**OpenStreetMap**- is an open source tool used within the FlatFinder project to identify and display properties. 

**Search**
	**Criteria** - Searchers can filter the results by specifying a start and end date, price range and 	a postcode for their accommodation. 
	**User Preferences** - these are inclinations a user has in common with another user or would 	prefer other users have. Preferences can be used to identify a potential 'buddy'. 


**Expressing interest**- As a user holding a 'Searcher' account type you are granted the ability to view properties and express interest. Expressing interest in a property does not obligate searchers into committing to a property but is rather intended to let landlords know a searcher has generated interest in their property. This can however allow searchers and landlords to open up a medium of communication and set up possible viewings and agreements.

**Buddying up** - Searchers can buddy up with other searchers in order to possibly co-rent a property. Upon initial, sign up users are prompted whether they're interested in potential buddying. It is possible for searchers to change this afterwards. 

**Software Architecture**- process of designing a structured solution that meets all the requirements.
