#Features for sprint 2
# Feature: Admin management
# 	In order to manage the system's userbase
# 	As an administrator I want to oversee communications and receive reports
# 	So that I can deal with them accordingly by suspending, expiring and deleting users and posts
#
#@domain
#Scenario: Delete user
# 	Given I am logged in as an administrator "james"
# 	When a user "bob" is reported for malicious behaviour
# 	Then I should be able to delete the user account "bob"
# 	And user "bob" is removed from the system
#
#@controller
#Scenario: Viewing reports from users
# 	Given I am logged in as an administrator "james"
# 	When a searcher "bob" makes a report about a user "ted"
# 	Then I should be notified
# 	And I should be able to view their report
#
#@domain
#Scenario: temporarily suspend user
# 	Given I am logged in as an administrator "james"

# 	Then I should be able to suspend them for 30 days
# 	And user "bob" cannot access the system for 30 days
#
#@controller
#Scenario: Searching for inactive users
# 	Given I am logged in as an administrator "james"

# 	Then only users that have been inactive for more than 365 days should show
#
#@controller
#Scenario: Search for inactive users
# 	Given I am logged in as an administrator "james"

#
#@controller
