Feature: Administrator management
 	In order to manage the system's user-base
 	As an administrator I want to oversee communications and receive reports
	So that I can deal with them accordingly by suspending, expiring and deleting users and posts

	Given a user "Bob"
 	And "Bob" is reported for malicious behaviour
 	When I delete the user account "Bob"
 	Then user "Bob" is removed from the system

Scenario: Deleting a user using controller
	Given a user "Bob"
	And "Bob" is reported for malicious behaviour
	When I located the user "Bob" on the delete user page 
	And click "delete account"

Scenario: Temporarily suspend user
 	Given a user "Bob"

	Given a user "Bob"
	And "Bob" is reported for malicious behaviour

	Then I should be redirect to "/suspend-users"
	
@Controller 
Scenario: Suspending a user that is already temporarily suspended
	Given a user "Bob"
	And "Bob" is already suspended for 30 days
	And "Bob" is reported for malicious behaviour
	When I located the user "Bob" on the suspend user page 
	Then I should be able to delete the user "Bob"
	And should be redirect to "/suspend-users"

	Given a user "Bob"
 	When a searcher "Bob" makes a report about a user "Ted"
 	Then I should be notified
	And I should be able to view their report

	Given I am an administrator "James"
 	And a listing "300 Welford Road" by a Landlord "Ted"
 	And I receive a false listing report

 	And I suspend landlord "Ted"
	Then the property "300 Welford Road" should be removed 
	And "Ted" account status should be suspend
