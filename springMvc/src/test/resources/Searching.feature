Feature: Searching for property

 In order to find property
 As a searcher I would like to filter by search criterion
 So that I can find property suited to me

@Controller
@NotImplemented
Scenario: Search by location
 Given I am logged in as searcher "Bob"
 And I enter a postcode "LE2 3AD"
 When I specify a distance of "2" mile radius
 Then only properties within "2" miles should show

@Controller
@NotImplemented
Scenario: Search by listing price
 Given I am logged in as searcher "Bob"
 When I filter by the price "750" or lower (PCM)
 Then I should only be able to see properties that cost "750" or less

@Controller
@NotImplemented
Scenario: Search by bedroom
 Given I am logged in as a searcher "Bob"
 When I filter by "4" bedrooms
 Then only property with "4" Bedrooms should be displayed

@Controller
@NotImplemented
Scenario: Filter by multiple criteria
 Given I am logged in as searcher "Bob"
 And I filter by "3" bedrooms
 And I filter by postcode "LE1 7RH"
 And I filter by radius (miles) "2"
 When I set the price to "800"
 Then only 3 bed room properties within 2 miles of "LE1 7RH" that cost "800" pounds PCM should show

@Controller
@NotImplemented
Scenario: Search by start date
 Given I am logged in as a searcher "Bob"
 And I filter listings by start date "01/03/2016/"
 When I set the end date "01/04/2016"
 Then I should be able to only see properties available from "01/03/2016" to "01/04/2016"

 @Controller
 @NotImplemented
 Scenario: Search for property that has been removed
  Given a Landlord "Bob
  And "Bob" has a property listing "123 Example Street" with postcode "SW1A 2AA"
  And price "300" pcm
  And a Searcher "Majid"
  And "Bob" searches for the property "123 Example Street"
  When "Bob" removes the property from his listing
  And "Majid" searches again for "123 Example Street"
  Then I should redirected to "noresult/property"
